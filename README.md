KinoCMS is a study project focused on developing a comprehensive web application for cinema
management. The project includes a landing page to showcase cinema schedules, upcoming movies, and
promotional content for users. Additionally, it features a CRM system built on the Django framework,
integrated with custom admin capabilities. The CRM allows administrators to manage user accounts,
movie listings, showtimes, and ticket bookings. The project also incorporates dynamic image galleries,
multilingual support, and real-time data visualisation with Google Charts, providing administrators with
insights into movie popularity and user statistics.
